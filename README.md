# CS460-Final-Project

To run this project, open the both projects in a recent release of Qt Creator. Make the projects using the make button, and then run first the server, and then the client. On the client, if necessary, enter both the IP address and the port number of the server, although only the port number should need to be entered. Then on the client, press the get fortune button.
